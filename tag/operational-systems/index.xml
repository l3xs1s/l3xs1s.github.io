      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year has been tough for us. Much has changed, but, alas, the world does not stand still and we must adapt to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I found out that in the new module we will not have calculus, I was glad. I thought: now Iâ€™ll pass everything without mathematical lessons at the izich &amp;hellip; How wrong I was &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having learned how many labs a week we would have to take, and how many, in my opinion, useless things, we would have to do, I wanted to get drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as time went on, doing laboratory and personal projects became a kind of routine, and I even started to like doing all this (perhaps this is all due to some kind of masochistic tendency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I hope you understand the whole way of creating these projects, and in the end I would like to quote the genius:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What decides the fate of mankind in this world? Some invisible being or law, like the Hand of the Lord hovering over the world? At least it is true that a person has no power even over his own will.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
