I thought: now I’ll pass everything without mathematical lessons at the izich … How wrong I was …\nHaving learned how many labs a week we would have to take, and how many, in my opinion, useless things, we would have to do, I wanted to get drunk.\nBut as time went on, doing laboratory and personal projects became a kind of routine, and I even started to like doing all this (perhaps this is all due to some kind of masochistic tendency).\nSo, I hope you understand the whole way of creating these projects, and in the end I would like to quote the genius:\n“What decides the fate of mankind in this world? Some invisible being or law, like the Hand of the Lord hovering over the world?
